# Inspecting network traffic with `tcpdump` and Wireshark

:::

::: {.cell .markdown}

In this experiment you will practice using tcpdump and Wireshark, two software applications for packet capture and packet analysis.

Using these applications, we can capture raw network data as it arrives at or leaves any host in our experiments, save the raw network packets in a file, and analyze the packets in this file in order to gain insight into network protocols and their behavior.
