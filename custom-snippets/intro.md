::: {.cell .markdown}

In this experiment you will practice using tcpdump and Wireshark, two software applications for packet capture and packet analysis.

Using these applications, we can capture raw network data as it arrives at or leaves any host in our experiments, save the raw network packets in a file, and analyze the packets in this file in order to gain insight into network protocols and their behavior.

In this notebook you will:

* Reserve resources for this experiment
* Configure your reserved resources
* Access your reserved resources over SSH

Then, you will follow the instructions in [Inspecting network traffic with tcpdump and Wireshark](https://witestlab.poly.edu/blog/wireshark-tcpdump/) to execute the experiment. 

Finally, you will

* Delete your resources when you are finished
